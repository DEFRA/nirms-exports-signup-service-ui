            Your admin will need to register your business’ account for the exporter service before you can submit a sign-up request
        </h1>

        <p>Contact your admin so they can register your business account for the service and give access to everyone who needs it.</p>

        <p>They will need to open their Defra account and follow these steps: </p>

        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li>Select 'Manage' for the business account you want to sign up with.</li>
            <li>Select 'Register for more services'.</li>
            <li>Select 'Exporter Service' from the list of services.</li>
            <li>Select your business.</li>
            <li>Select 'Manage team access' for your business and add anyone who needs access.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Once your admin has done this, you can return to the previous page to <a asp-page="@Routes.Pages.Path.RegisteredBusinessBusinessPickerPath">select your business</a> – you will need to select 'Refresh list of businesses' to make sure your account has updated.</p>
